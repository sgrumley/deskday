add to readme:
- chmod +x setup.sh required 
- example adding to .zshrc
- example of only running if in term eg if not vscode
- setup.sh needs to refer to netcount script, what is the best way to do this?  can this be a relative path?

add ansi
  - should also change colors based on progress
  - colors to text 
where should db go?
refactor any script call to ./scripts
refactor format pkg -> could this be a basic pkg for text in terminal?
